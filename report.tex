\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We trained machine learning agents that manipulate an emulated NES controller to play Dr.~Mario.
Both Q-learning and SARSA learning algorithms showed some advantage over a random controller.
We compared a SARSA agent that viewed the local ``neighborhood'' around the player's capsule and controlled the controller directly to a Q-learning agent that viewed the entire topmost layer of viruses and executed high-level actions in the game. Ultimately, while we believe the local ``neighborhood'' state space may allow for the highest theoretical quality of performance, the Q-learning agent with a high-level controller yielded the best results, with the fastest rate of learning and the highest average performance.
